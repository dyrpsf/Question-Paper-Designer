Question Paper Designer - Project Statements
Problem Statement
Educational institutions and examination bodies face significant challenges in creating well-structured question papers that meet specific academic standards and requirements. The current manual process of question paper design is:

Time-consuming: Educators spend hours compiling questions, formatting, and ensuring proper structure

Error-prone: Manual processes lead to inconsistencies in marking schemes, difficulty levels, and question distribution

Inconsistent: Lack of standardized templates results in varying quality across different question papers

Inefficient: Difficulty in maintaining question banks and reusing questions effectively

Compliance challenges: Ensuring question papers meet specific curriculum requirements and examination patterns

Scope of the Project
In-Scope

Template System: Pre-defined templates for various question paper patterns (MCQ, descriptive, mixed)

Automated Generation: Generate question papers based on predefined criteria and constraints

Customization: Allow manual editing and customization of auto-generated question papers
