Question Paper Designer - Project Statements

Problem Statement

Educational institutions and examination bodies face significant challenges in creating well-structured question papers that meet specific academic standards and requirements. The current manual process of question paper design is:

1. Time-consuming: Educators spend hours compiling questions, formatting, and ensuring proper structure

2. Error-prone: Manual processes lead to inconsistencies in marking schemes, difficulty levels, and question distribution

3. Inconsistent: Lack of standardized templates results in varying quality across different question papers

4. Inefficient: Difficulty in maintaining question banks and reusing questions effectively

5. Compliance challenges: Ensuring question papers meet specific curriculum requirements and examination patterns

Scope of the Project

In-Scope
1. Question Bank Management: Create, store, edit, and categorize questions with metadata

2. Template System: Pre-defined templates for various question paper patterns (MCQ, descriptive, mixed)

3. Automated Generation: Generate question papers based on predefined criteria and constraints

4. Customization: Allow manual editing and customization of auto-generated question papers

5. Export Functionality: Export question papers to multiple formats (PDF, Word, etc.)

6. 6User Management: Role-based access for different types of users

7. Marking Scheme Integration: Automatic calculation and distribution of marks

Out-of-Scope
1. Online Examination Conduct: The system focuses on paper creation, not test administration

2. Student Performance Analytics: No tracking or analysis of student results

3. Plagiarism Detection: Advanced content similarity checking

4. Mobile Application: Primary focus is web-based platform

6. Multi-language Support: Initial version supports English language only

7. AI-based Question Generation: Manual question input with automated paper assembly
